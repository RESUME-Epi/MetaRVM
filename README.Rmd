This is a compartmental model simulation code for generic respiratory virus diseases.

## Model

![Model schematics](man/figures/model.png)

## Installation

You can install the development version of MetaRVM from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("NSF-RESUME/MetaRVM")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows how to run the simulation from R command line.

```{r example}
library(MetaRVM)
```

We will create some data sets that will be used for this demonstration. This is a meta-population model, i.e., the total population is divided in several sub-populations (based on some common attributes such as zones, age-groups, races etc.). The mixing pattern within and between these sub-populations are dictated by a mixing matrix, which will be explained later. In summary, to run the meta-population simulation, we need 
1. population sizes and model initialization information,
2. vaccination information,
3. mixing matrices.

#### Population

For this example, we define our sub-populations by the 6 HCZ (Healthy Chicago Zone) in Chicago, IL. For each sub-population we need to provide the model the total population size (N), number of susceptible (S), infectious (I) and vaccinated (v) people at the start of the simulation.

```{r data}
## Model initialization
N_pop <- 6
pop_zones <- data.frame(N = rep(NA, N_pop),
                        S0 = rep(NA, N_pop),
                        I0 = rep(NA, N_pop),
                        V0 = rep(NA, N_pop))

pop_zones$N <- sample(1000:1500, N_pop)
pop_zones$I0 <- sample(10:100, N_pop)
pop_zones$V0 <- sample(1:10, N_pop)
pop_zones$S0 <- pop_zones$N - pop_zones$I0 - pop_zones$V0

pop_zones
```

#### Vaccination

The vaccination data has the time indices when the vaccination occured in the first column with the column name `t` and the other columns contain the number vaccinations in each sub-populations ordered from left to right. 

```{r}
## Vaccine profile
tt <- seq(0, 100, by = 14)
nt <- length(tt)
vol <- sample(1:10, (nt-1)*N_pop, replace = TRUE)

vac_zones <- cbind(tt, rbind(pop_zones$V0, matrix(vol, nrow = nt-1)))
colnames(vac_zones) <- c("t", paste0("v", 1:N_pop))

vac_zones
```



```{r}
## mixing matrix

m1 <- m2 <- m3 <- m4 <- matrix(NA, nrow = N_pop, ncol = N_pop)
diag(m1) <- round(runif(N_pop, min = 0.85, max = 0.92), 2)
diag(m2) <- 1
diag(m3) <- round(runif(N_pop, min = 0.7, max = 0.9), 2)
diag(m4) <- 1

for(ii in 1:N_pop){
  tmp <- runif(N_pop - 1)
  m1[ii, -ii] <- round(tmp * (1 - m1[ii, ii]) / sum(tmp), 2)
  m2[ii, -ii] <- 0
  m3[ii, -ii] <- round(tmp * (1 - m3[ii, ii]) / sum(tmp), 2)
  m4[ii, -ii] <- 0
}

m_weekday_day <- m1
m_weekday_night <- m2
m_weekend_day <- m3
m_weekend_night <- m4
```

Then run the simulation:

```{r sim}
out <- meta_sim(N_pop = N_pop,
                beta_i = 0.7,
                beta_v = 0.2,
                S0 = pop_zones$S0,
                I0 = pop_zones$I0,
                P0 = pop_zones$N,
                V0 = pop_zones$V0,
                m_weekday_day = m_weekday_day,
                m_weekend_day = m_weekend_day,
                m_weekday_night = m_weekday_night,
                m_weekend_night = m_weekend_night,
                delta_t = 0.5,
                tvac = vac_zones[, 1],
                vac_mat = as.matrix(vac_zones[, 2:7]),
                VtoS = 0.02,
                 EtoIpresymp = 0.33,
                 etopa = 0.5,
                 pretoIsymp = 0.5,
                 IasymptoR = 0.2,
                 IsymptoRH = 0.5,
                 istohr = 0.5,
                 HtoRD = 0.33,
                 htor = 0.5,
                 RtoS = 0.02,
                 vac_eff = 0.5,
                 nsteps = 100,
                 is.stoch = 0,
                 seed = NULL)
```

There are some utility functions to extract a subset of disease states from the output data frame. For example, if we want to extract all infectious compartments, we can do this by the utility function `get_disease_state`. We can further subset the output by HCE zone id.

```{r}
out_I <- get_disease_state(data.frame(out), disease_states = c("I_presymp", "I_asymp", "I_symp"))
out_I_hce2 <- get_HCEZ(data.frame(out), disease_states = c("I_presymp", "I_asymp", "I_symp"), HCEZ_id = 2)
```

## Vizualizations

These are some easy way to create visualizations on the output of the simulation. These functionalities will be added later as functions to the package.

#### Aggregate level plot

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

compartment_colors <- c("S" = "steelblue3",
                              "E" = "tan1",

                              "I_asymp" = "orangered2",
                              "I_symp" = "red4",

                              "V" = "darkgreen")

long_out <- get_disease_state(data.frame(out))

ggplot(long_out %>% filter(disease_state %in% c("S", "E", "H", "D",
                                                "I_presymp", "I_asymp",
                                                "I_symp", "R", "V")) %>%
                          mutate(disease_state = factor(disease_state,
                                                        levels = c("S", "E", "H", "D",
                                                                   "I_presymp", "I_asymp",
                                                                   "I_symp", "R", "V"))) %>%
                          group_by(step, disease_state) %>%
                          summarize(total_value = sum(value), .groups = "drop"),
       aes(x = step, y = total_value, color = disease_state)) +
          geom_line(linewidth = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
          scale_color_manual(values = compartment_colors) +
          labs(
            title = "Disease Compartments Over Time",
            x = "steps",
            y = "Counts",
            color = "Compartment",
          ) +
          theme_bw() +
          theme(
            plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
            legend.position = "right"
          )
```
