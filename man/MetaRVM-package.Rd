\title{MetaRVM: Meta-population compartmental model for respiratory virus diseases}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

A comprehensive R package for simulating respiratory virus epidemics using meta-population compartmental models. MetaRVM implements a stochastic SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead) framework with demographic stratification by age, race, and geographic zones. The package supports complex epidemiological scenarios including asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, hospitalization dynamics, vaccination campaigns, and time-varying contact patterns. Key features include: (1) flexible YAML-based configuration system for model parameters and population data, (2) R6 class architecture for structured data handling and method chaining, (3) automated output formatting with calendar dates and demographic attributes, (4) comprehensive analysis methods for data summarization across demographic categories, (5) intelligent visualization capabilities with adaptive plotting based on data structure, and (6) support for uncertainty quantification through multiple stochastic simulation instances. The package is designed for epidemiologists, public health researchers, and policy makers who need robust tools for infectious disease modeling and scenario analysis.
