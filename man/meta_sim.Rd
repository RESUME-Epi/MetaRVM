\description{
The core simulation engine that implements a stochastic compartmental SEIRD
(Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead) model for respiratory virus
epidemics across multiple demographic subpopulations. The function compiles
and executes an ODIN-based differential equation model with time-varying
contact patterns, vaccination dynamics, and complex disease progression pathways.
}
\details{
The model implements a metapopulation epidemiological framework with the following features:

\strong{Compartmental Structure:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{S}: Susceptible individuals
\item \strong{E}: Exposed (incubating) individuals
\item \strong{I_presymp}: Presymptomatic infectious individuals
\item \strong{I_asymp}: Asymptomatic infectious individuals
\item \strong{I_symp}: Symptomatic infectious individuals
\item \strong{H}: Hospitalized individuals
\item \strong{R}: Recovered individuals
\item \strong{D}: Deceased individuals
\item \strong{V}: Vaccinated individuals
\item \strong{P}: Total living population (excludes deaths)
}

\strong{Disease Progression Pathways:}
\enumerate{
\item \strong{S → E}: Exposure through contact with infectious individuals
\item \strong{E → I_asymp/I_presymp}: Progression to infectious states (proportion pea)
\item \strong{I_presymp → I_symp}: Development of symptoms
\item \strong{I_asymp → R}: Direct recovery from asymptomatic state
\item \strong{I_symp → R/H}: Recovery or hospitalization (proportion psr)
\item \strong{H → R/D}: Hospital discharge or death (proportion phr)
\item \strong{R → S}: Loss of immunity
\item \strong{S → V}: Vaccination
\item \strong{V → S/E}: Vaccine waning or breakthrough infection
}

\strong{Mixing Patterns:}
Contact patterns vary by:
\itemize{
\item Day of week: Weekday vs. weekend patterns
\item Time of day: Day (6 AM - 6 PM) vs. night (6 PM - 6 AM) patterns
\item Each pattern specified by N_pop × N_pop contact matrix
}

\strong{Force of Infection:}
Transmission occurs through contact between susceptible/vaccinated individuals and
all infectious compartments (I_presymp + I_asymp + I_symp), modified by:
\itemize{
\item Population-specific transmission rates (ts, tv)
\item Time-varying contact patterns
\item Vaccine effectiveness for breakthrough infections
}

\strong{Stochastic vs. Deterministic Mode:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Deterministic}: Uses exact differential equations
\item \strong{Stochastic}: Adds demographic stochasticity via binomial draws
}

\strong{Vaccination Implementation:}
Vaccination is implemented as time-varying input with:
\itemize{
\item Scheduled vaccination counts per time step and subpopulation
\item Vaccine effectiveness reducing infection probability
\item Waning immunity returning individuals to susceptible state
}
}
\section{Parameter Scaling}{

All duration parameters are automatically converted to rates (1/duration).
Scalar parameters are automatically expanded to vectors of length N_pop.
This allows flexible specification of homogeneous or heterogeneous parameters.
}

\section{Checkpointing}{

When do_chk = TRUE, the function saves a checkpoint file containing:
\itemize{
\item Final compartment states for simulation continuation
\item All model parameters for reproducibility
\item Vaccination schedule data
\item Population structure information
}
}
