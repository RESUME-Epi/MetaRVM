Description: A comprehensive R package for simulating respiratory virus epidemics 
    using meta-population compartmental models. MetaRVM implements a stochastic 
    SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead) framework with demographic
    stratification by age, race, and geographic zones. The package supports complex
    epidemiological scenarios including asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission,
    hospitalization dynamics, vaccination campaigns, and time-varying contact patterns.
    Key features include: (1) flexible YAML-based configuration system for model
    parameters and population data, (2) R6 class architecture for structured data
    handling and method chaining, (3) automated output formatting with calendar
    dates and demographic attributes, (4) comprehensive analysis methods for data
    summarization across demographic categories, (5) intelligent visualization
    capabilities with adaptive plotting based on data structure, and (6) support
    for uncertainty quantification through multiple stochastic simulation instances.
    The package is designed for epidemiologists, public health researchers, and
    policy makers who need robust tools for infectious disease modeling and
    scenario analysis.
