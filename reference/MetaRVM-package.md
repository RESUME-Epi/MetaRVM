# MetaRVM: Meta-population Compartmental Model for Respiratory Virus Diseases

A comprehensive R package for simulating respiratory virus epidemics
using meta-population compartmental models. MetaRVM implements a
stochastic SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead) framework
with demographic stratification by age, race, and geographic zones. The
package supports complex epidemiological scenarios including
asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, hospitalization dynamics,
vaccination campaigns, and time-varying contact patterns.
