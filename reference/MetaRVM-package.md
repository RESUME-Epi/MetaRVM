# MetaRVM: Meta-population compartmental model for respiratory virus diseases

A comprehensive R package for simulating respiratory virus epidemics
using meta-population compartmental models. MetaRVM implements a
stochastic SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead) framework
with demographic stratification by age, race, and geographic zones. The
package supports complex epidemiological scenarios including
asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, hospitalization dynamics,
vaccination campaigns, and time-varying contact patterns. Key features
include: (1) flexible YAML-based configuration system for model
parameters and population data, (2) R6 class architecture for structured
data handling and method chaining, (3) automated output formatting with
calendar dates and demographic attributes, (4) comprehensive analysis
methods for data summarization across demographic categories, (5)
intelligent visualization capabilities with adaptive plotting based on
data structure, and (6) support for uncertainty quantification through
multiple stochastic simulation instances. The package is designed for
epidemiologists, public health researchers, and policy makers who need
robust tools for infectious disease modeling and scenario analysis.
